            HTML stands for HyperText Markup
            Language. It is used to design
            web pages using a markup language.
            HTML is the combination of Hypertext
            and Markup language. Hypertext
            defines the link between the web
            pages. A markup language is used
            to define the text document within
            tag which defines the structure of
            web pages. HTML is a markup language
            that is used by the browser to
            manipulate text, images, and other
            content to display it in the required
            format.

            C is a procedural programming language.
            It was initially developed by Dennis
            Ritchie as a system programming
            language to write operating system.
            The main features of C language include
            low-level access to memory, simple set
            of keywords, and clean style, these
            features make C language suitable for
            system programming like operating system
            or compiler development.

            Java has been one of the most
            popular programming language
            for many years. Java is Object
            Oriented. However it is not
            considered as pure object oriented
            as it provides support for primitive
            data types (like int, char, etc) The
            Java codes are first compiled into byte
            code (machine independent code). Then
            the byte code is run on Java Virtual
            Machine (JVM) regardless of the
            underlying architecture.
